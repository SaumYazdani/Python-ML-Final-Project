This code predicts the value of the $SPY ticker (SPDR S&P 500 ETF). Why the SPY? The SPY is comprised of 500 large and mid capped companies. The ETF can be considered an indicator for the rest of the stock market since it is comprised of well known stable growing companies, thus it can be argued that if the SPY is not doing well for the day, the rest of the market may also be struggling (it can also be considered an arbitrary gauge for investor confidence).
